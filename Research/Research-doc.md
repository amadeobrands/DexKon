A useful extension of this work would be the development of a decision aid capable of generating basic operating statement and balance sheet data and enabling cooperative decision makers to conduct experiments concerning alternative financing strategies based on retained earnings.

Cooperatives as a means of organizing multi-farmer agricultural production enterprises, despite some initial and continuing enthusiasm, have run afoul of the same weaknesses that underlie their general failure in the West: the seeming impossibility of implementing the basic principles. The central issues involve management decision-making and coordination. These tasks according to cooperative principles are essentially ones of self-government by equally empowered farmer-members, i.e., they are issues of politics. These arrangement scan work successfully for homeowner associations, labor unions, and clubs of many kinds, so why not for farms? The difficulties pointed to in the Central and Eastern European cases are ones of getting agreement on many managerial decisions and on mobilization of capital for investment in the cooperative, but most of all on the division of revenues or profits among members whose contributions to the business vary. The difficulties lead to a tendency toward devolution of responsibilities, assets, and revenues toward individual members (leading to a loose association of independent farmers), or alternatively to managerial decision-making by a hired executive or outside entity (converting the enterprise to acorporation or subsidiary of a non-agricultural enterprise).

The cooperatives in Tajikistan are fledgling efforts which are badly in need of training and guidance. The general feeling is that cooperatives, once launched fairly effectively with donor assistance, are left pretty much on their own, without follow-up assistance, monitoring, and guidance. Cooperative managers naturally complain of difficulties with purchasing machinery or raising credit, but beyond that it is clear that they are untrained and without experiencing in managing a service cooperative. All cooperatives have formal business plans, but managers need training and guidance on how to implement the plans and how to work toward achieving their strategic objectives. Training and learning programs are needed for existing and potential cooperative managers (and also members).

EXPECTED growth in the agricultural sector has highlighted the need for cooperatives to step into the gap when the government and banks fail to supply credit.
Asian Farmers’ Association (AFA) Cooperative Development Program Director Cresente C. Paez noted that some savings and credit cooperatives are starting to expand their services to farmers.
